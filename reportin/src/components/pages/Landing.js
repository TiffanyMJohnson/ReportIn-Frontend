           <p> The Gunslingers Drill Team was formed in 1991 with thier Red and Black western-styled uniforms. The team is comprised of members ranging in age from 6 to 19 with differing experience levels. With the complexity of rifles and hand drills in thier military style routines, the Gunslingers travel throughout Washington state participating in different competitions and parades. The Gunslingers Drill team is based out of Lake Stevens, Washington, but their members come from all over the Snohomish County area (Lynnwood, Everett, Lake Stevens, Marysville, and Arlington). If you or your child are intrested in joining or would like additional information please contact us. </p>
