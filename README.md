### ReportIn

In an age where everything is going digital, there are not many applications out there to help with youth sports team management. This is where ReportIn will shine. ReportIn is an app that is designed for teams/groups to allow them to communicate memos and view upcoming events on the calendar. This specific application was designed for one client. 

As an user, I am able to create, edit, and delete memos that are posted for my team members/parents to be able to read. I can also to add events to the calendar.
